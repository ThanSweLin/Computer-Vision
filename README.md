# Computer-Vision

## Image Basic
(1) Opening Image files with OpenCV
(2) Drawing on Images (Rectangle, Triangle, Cricle)
(3) Direct Drawing on Images with a mouse

## Image Processing
(1) Apply a binary threshold onto the image
(2) Convert the image colorspace to HSV(Hue, Saturation, Value) and display the image
(3) A low pass filter with a 4 by 4 Kernel filled with values of 1/10(0.01) and then use 2-D Convolution to blur the image(displayed in normal RGB)
(4) A Horizontal Sobel Filter with a kernel size of 5 to the grayscale version of the image and then display the resulting gradient filtered version of the image
(5) Plot the histograms for the RED, BLUE and GREEN channel of the lion image
