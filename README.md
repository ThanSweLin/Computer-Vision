# Computer-Vision

## Image Basic
(1) Opening Image files with OpenCV <br>
(2) Drawing on Images (Rectangle, Triangle, Cricle) <br>
(3) Direct Drawing on Images with a mouse <br>

## Image Processing
(1) Apply a binary threshold onto the image <br>
(2) Convert the image colorspace to HSV(Hue, Saturation, Value) and display the image <br>
(3) A low pass filter with a 4 by 4 Kernel filled with values of 1/10(0.01) and then use 2-D Convolution to blur the image(displayed in normal RGB) <br>
(4) A Horizontal Sobel Filter with a kernel size of 5 to the grayscale version of the image and then display the resulting gradient filtered version of the image <br>
(5) Plot the histograms for the RED, BLUE and GREEN channel of the lion image
